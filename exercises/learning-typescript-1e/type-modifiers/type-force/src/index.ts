// Write your duel function and types below! âœ¨
// You'll need to export duel so the tests can run it.

// Create and export a `duel` function with two parameters, `good` and `bad`, both of which are objects containing the following properties:
//
// - `mutations`: Array of strings that are keys in the `mutationsLibrary` object
// - `name`: A string
//
// Internally it will create a character for each variable.
// A character object can be created with the following steps:
//
// 1. Initialize a `flying` property as `false`, and `power` and `toughness` as `1`
// 2. For each mutation in the power, run the corresponding function from `mutationsLibrary` on the character
//
// The `duel` function's return type should be a read-only tuple containing two elements:
//
// 1. Either `"hero"` or `"villain"`, indicating who won, as computed by who has the higher of: their power divided by the other character's toughness
// 2. The winning character object
