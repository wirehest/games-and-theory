Exercise 7

Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = []

# using for loop and append
for i in a:
    if i % 2 == 0:
        b.append(i)

print(f"Even elements from your list:\n{b}")

# using list comprehension
c = [i for i in a if i % 2 == 0]
print(f"Via list comprehension:\n{c}")
